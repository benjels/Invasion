Aim:
The aim of the game is to survive and defend the pylons for as long as possible/
Waves of attackers constantly spawn and try to attack the pylons and you and it is your job to defend them and yourself.


NOTE:

the networking component of our game has not been implemented. As such, it is better if you mostly play the game as the fighter class because he can use the gun to more easily kill enemies.
The sorcerer class was meant as a support character that moves around quickly placing portals for the fighter and collecting items. We cannot play 2 player, so maybe just  play a little as sorcerer
to see how its abilities work etc.

also note that the game is best played from the standard NORTH orientation.



Items:
Gun - this can be used to shoot at the robots (if you are playing as the fighter and have gun in inventory)
portal Gun - you can place a portal on the ground, move to another position, and place another teleporter. If you step on either of these portals you placed, you will teleport to the other portal, and then the teleporters will disappear.
if you place a portal when there are already two portals, the oldest one will be replaced.
E.g. you can get the pylon attacker robots to kill one another by placing a telelporter in front of the robot and another in front of another robot so that when one teleports, they can damage one another.
Money - used to buy health kits in the shop (downloadable DLC coming soon)
Health kit - use f to use it to get some health back if in currently selected inventory
Night Vision Goggles - allows you to see further away entities at night time
Key Card - Used to travel through the locked teleporter
Locked teleporter - can only be used if you have a key card
Standard teleporter - teleports you to other rooms
Treasure- pick it up and then drop it in the secret room (that the locked teleporter leads to) to unlock extra money
Small Carrier/Medium Carrier bags - allows you to store more items in your inventory




Map:
There are two pylon rooms and four maze rooms. One at the top and one at the bottom. The waves of pylon attackers spawn at alternating pylon rooms. you must walk through two maze rooms to get to the other pylon room.
Note that all of the standard unlocked teleporters are one way only. you will find yourslef looping around the map. The rectangular mini map at the bottom of the screen shows the map and the health of
each pylon. THE TELEPORTERS THAT YOU MUST REACH IN THE MAZE ROOMS ARE DIAGONALLY OPPOSITE TO THE TELEPORTER ENTRANCE THAT YOU ARRIVED IN. hidden by painters algorithm.
