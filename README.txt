Aim:
The aim of the game is to survive and get as many points as you can.
In the first room, there are 4 robots, which all target the pylon. You have to protect this pylon by defeating the robots using the gun. If you don't protect the pylon, you will lose.
Throughout the game, there is also a flame enemy following you. If the flame enemy catches you, you lose.

Items:
Gun - this can be used to shoot at the robots
Teleporter Gun - you can place a teleporter on the ground, move to another position, and place another teleporter. If you step on either of these teleporters you placed, you will teleport to the other telporter, and then the teleporters will disappear.
E.g. you can get the robots to kill one another by placing a telelporter in front of the robot and another in front of another robot so that when one teleports, they can damage one another.
